# e-commerce clustering

Here a csv file, containing sales data of an e-commerce company is given (Sample-Superstore.csv). The aim is to cluster the customers based on three parameters: Monetary (amount of money spent), Frequency (how frequently the customer bought something) Recency (how many days has passed from today to their last purchase). First I analysed the data and made the EDA and then I used K-means clustering which an unsupervised machine learning. 

EDA.ipynb contains the code for the EDA of the dataset.

table_creation.ipynb is used for creating a database, named Samp.db. It generates some tables in this database. 

In exercises.ipynb, I further investigated the dataset by answering some questions. 

And Group_customers.ipynb contains the code for k-means clustering.
