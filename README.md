# e-commerce clustering

Here I have a csv file, containing sales data of an e-commerce company. The aim is after analysing data (and making EDA) cluster the customer based on three parameters: Monetary (amount of money spent), Frequency (how frequently the customer bought something) Recency (how many days has passed from today to their last purchase). 

EDA.ipynb contains the code for the EDA of the dataset.

table_creation.ipynb is used for creating a database, named Samp.db and generates some tables in this database. 

In exercises.ipynb, I further investigated the dataset by answering to some questions. 

And Group_customers.ipynb contains the code of k-means clustering.
